Setting the project up

`git pull` and `docker-compose up --build -d` should do the trick


Done list
0. Setup docker-compose to ensure ease of development (with auto reloading) and deployment
1. Load Neo4J dataset into DB
2. Backend to pull data from Neo4J data


TODO list
1. Simple frontend, using react-force-graph to display nodes from backend. Will always display Entity nodes first
2. View the properties of a node
3. Clicking on a node will bring spawn connected nodes, which will then be added and displayed
